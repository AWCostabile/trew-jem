# :gem: TREW-JEM

The **_Trew-Jem_** starter pack is tailored towards fast cross-platform development and project prototyping with certain assumptions made about how you intend to create your application.

The name is an abbreviation of the main packages that it consists of, though there are other packages to give credit to as well!

```
  Typescript    React       Express     Webpack
  Jest          Emotion     MobX
```

This starter might not be for all projects, but hopefully it will come in handy for common scenarios encountered in most SaaS products. The idea here is to remove the headache of starting a new project and jumping right into development!
